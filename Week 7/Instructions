Document instructions:
Look<x>: The time starts with the user looking straight, and then every 4 seconds, the user looks in the specified direction x and immediately returns their eyes to the centre. 
LookLeftHold: User starts with eyes looking straight. They then move their eyes left at 4 seconds and hold their eyes there. After another 4 seconds, they move their eyes back to looking forward and remain here for 4 seconds. We then repeat this. Every negative peak is the user moving eyes left, and the positive peaks are them moving eyes back to centre.
LookRightHold is the same but for looking right instead of left. This is the same for LookUpHold and LookDownHold.
LookRightHold2 is the same as LookRightHold, but includes a blink before every eye movement. I.e. before the user moves eyes to the right, they do a single blink. There are no other blinks during the entire time.
LookRightHold3 involves the user initially looking straight for 4 seconds, then taking 2 seconds to look right, then holding here for 4 seconds, then taking 2 seconds to look back to straight. Repeat.
Blink: The user deliberately blinks every 4 seconds. Blink2 is the exact same.
EyebrowRaise: Initially looks straight for 4 seconds, then raise eyebrows and immediately bring them back to normal. Do this every 4 seconds.
EyebrowRaiseHold: Look straight for 4 seconds, then raise eyebrows and hold for 4 seconds. Lower eyebrows to normal after these 4 seconds. Repeat.
